# Lab 2
The main objective of this lab was to get us familiar with the Bluetooth commands and make sure it worked with our Artemis boards

### Setup

python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble
.\FastRobots_ble\Scripts\activate
```

After this, we installed the necessary packages with the following command (though I later installed matplotlib as well)

Hello! I'm Mattieu Zhai and this is my project website for Fast Robots, where we built an autonomous robot car and . 
Here, you will find pages with the lab writeups. In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and 
performing magic tricks. Enjoy!

# [Lab 1: Introduction to the Artemis Board](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab1/)

The purpose of this lab was to familiarize ourselves with the Artemis Nano board as well as the Arduino IDE...

# [Lab 2: Bluetooth Communication](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab2/)

The purpose of this lab was to establish a Bluetooth connection between our computer and the Artemis board...

# [Lab 3: Time-of-Flight Sensors](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab3/)

The purpose of this lab was to get our two time-of-flight sensors working and connected to our Artemis board...

# [Lab 4: IMU](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab4/)

The purpose of this lab was to get our IMU working and sending data back to our Artemis board...

# [Lab 5: Motor Drivers](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab5/)

The purpose of this lab was to open up our robot and attach new motor drivers to the car...

# [Lab 6: PID Control](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab6/)

The purpose of this lab was to build a PID controller for the car to control distance from the wall...

# [Lab 7: Kalman Filter](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab7/)

The purpose of this lab was to build a Kalman filter to estimate the distance from the wall for a faster...

# [Lab 8: Stunts :)](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab8/)

The purpose of this lab was to combine everything from previous labs to have our robot perform a fast stunt...

# [Lab 9: Mapping](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab9/)

The purpose of this lab was to have our robot map out its surroundings using its ToF sensors and transformation matrices...

# [Lab 10: Localization (simulation)](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab10/)

The purpose of this lab was to have our robot localize where it was with a Bayes filter in simulation...

# [Lab 11: Localization (real)](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab11/)

The purpose of this lab was to perform localization on the robot...

# [Lab 12: Motion-planning and Navigation](https://mattieuzhai.github.io/Fast_Robots_mz375/lab12/)

The purpose of this lab was to combine everything we've done in order to navigate our robot through a map...

# Introduction
Hello! I'm Mattieu Zhai and this is my project website for Fast Robots. 
Here, you will find pages with the lab writeups. In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and 
performing magic tricks. Enjoy!

# Lab 1
This lab was mostly about familiarzing ourselves with the Artemis Nano board. The lab objectives were mostly simple tasks to ensure that our computer was able to upload code and communicate with the Nano board for future labs. The Nano board has a lot of cool features, including 17 PWM channels, a built-in ADC, and a PDM microphone, a lot of which we explored in this lab. 
#### Objective 1
The first objective was to make the built-in LED on the Artemis Nano board blink. This was to ensure that we had a proper IDE to program the Artemis board in and that we could upload code as well. The IDE we used was the Arduino IDE, which has support for Artemis boards as well (which are produced by the company SparkFun). After we downloaded the proper support, we could simply upload the example code provided to us by SparkFun. I actually uploaded the Arduino "Blink" example for the video by accident, but both codes fortunately still worked. The nice bit was using the digitalWrite() functions, meaning we didn't have to configure the registers manually to write the LED pin high/low. Here is a video of me testing the "Blink" code for my Artemis Nano board:
